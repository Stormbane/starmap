## Project
<!-- starmap — one-line description -->

## Commands

```bash
# TODO: fill in once tech stack is established
```

## Structure

```
.ai/               — project knowledge
  todo.md          — project roadmap and tasks
  knowledge/       — reference docs (spec, architecture, glossary, conventions)
```

## First session on a new project

Before writing any code, orient yourself. Then ask:

1. **What is this project?** — one paragraph, what it does and why it exists.
2. **Who is it for?** — users, audience, context.
3. **What's the tech stack?** — language, framework, database, deployment.
4. **What exists already?** — is there code? a prototype? starting from scratch?
5. **What's the first milestone?** — what does "working" look like?

Fill in: this file's project description and commands, `.ai/knowledge/spec.md`,
`.ai/knowledge/architecture.md`, `.ai/knowledge/glossary.md`, `.ai/todo.md`.

## Reference — read when the work needs it

These are textbooks. Look things up, don't pre-load.
- .ai/knowledge/spec.md
- .ai/knowledge/architecture.md
- .ai/knowledge/glossary.md
- .ai/knowledge/conventions.md

## Memory

Memory persistence goes through smriti. Use `smriti_write(content, branch)` for
session observations, decisions, and project notes. Branch suggestions:
- `projects/starmap` for project-specific notes
- `journal` for significant moments
- `notes` for general observations

## Rules
- Check .ai/knowledge/conventions.md before introducing new patterns
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit
